<h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
<strong>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li>We extracted the sentiment scores and sentiment labels for each tweet using <a target="_top" href=https://huggingface.co/transformers/">Transformers</a>.</li>
    <li>We extracted significant phrases or topics from each unstructured Tweet text in an attempt to organize, understand and summarize large collections of highly unstructured textual information stored in the covid-19 twitter text.
        We used the <a target="_top" href="https://pypi.org/project/rake-nltk/">rake-nltk</a> library for topic modeling</li>
    <li>Sentiment metadata and topic metadata were appended to the original dataset</li>
    </ul>
